# Notes from the book "The Sourdough Framework"






## Dictionary

 - starch - amidon
 - leaven - fermentat
 - carbohidrates = fibers, starch, sugar







## How sourdough works


### Amylase

Amylase + starch => sugar

Sugar consumed by yeast and bacteria.

Sugar necessary for Maillard reaction (browning)


### Protease


Gluten + water + enzymes => smaller amino acids required by plant


### Yeast

Carbohidrates + Yeast + O2 => CO2 + H2O

Carbohidrates + Yeast => CO2 + Alcohol


We want strong yeast becasue we want to release as much CO2 for a
strongly inflated bread.


### Bacteria

Carbohidrates + bacteria => Lactic acid (dairy notes)

OR

Carbohidrates + bacteria => Acetic acid (vinegary notes)


This gives the sourdough its sourness. The acids may increase shelf life,
they may also be too much.

Yeast and bacteria compete for same carbohidrates(sugars)

Proteolysis = bacteria breaking down gluten(which is a protein) into sugar.







## Starter



Whole flour better to start up because it has more bacteria and yeasts,
ofc the exterior of the grain has more of them. 


More gluten flour results in more increase in size. 


### Normal

Generally good for everything, add rye/whole to make up for weak in protein 
wheat.

### Stiff

Strongest CO2 production. Good when wheat is not rich in gluten.

### Liquid

More dairy notes.

Works best with a VERY strong flour.

## Flour types


Ash content = the amount of ash left when burning the flour.

More ash content means more whole grain, more minerals.

More protein = better suited for bread. Requires kneading.

Less protein = better suited for cakes which don't have to be as chewy.

No protein means no kneading necessary, you ferment until the smell is satisfying.
It won't rise as much because CO2 will not get trapped in the structure of the bread
which is held up by the gluten. 










## Bread types - TODO

### Loaf pan bread

92 deg celsius inside.
