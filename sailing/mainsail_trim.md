## Mainsail controls

### Mainsheet

Settings:

#### Close hauled

 - Boom closest to center line, mainsheet exerts downforce
 - Don't heel too much
 - Maintaining consistent heel is the fast way to sail

#### Reaching
 - Close reaching - boom close to center line
 - Beam reaching - boom roughly half way out
 - Broad reaching - boom 3/4 way out

#### Running
 - Boom perpendicular to the center line of the boat

### Traveller

Used when sailing close hauled

Determines the angle at which the mainsheet pull on the sail which in turn affects leech shape (twist).

This is because the mainsheet will exert more or less downforce on the sail, straightening or opening the leech.

The more downforce the straighter the leech.

Settings:

 - Traveller up -> ease mainsheet -> less downforce -> more twist
 - Traveller on the center line(or sometimes even lower) -> tighten mainsheet -> more downforce -> less twist

In strong winds when you can not set the traveller any lower(and on ships on which it is hard to trim the traveller)
it is better to vang sheet.
That means to tighten the vang in order to prevent the boom from lifting and thus maintinging a tight leech.
The mainsheet will be eased during gusts to maintain heel instead of the traveller.

### Vang

Vang is used to control leech shape by exerting only downforce on the boom. When vang is in use mainsheet role
is relegated to simply pulling the boom in or letting it out.

#### Close hauled

Always ease the vang in light/medium airs. We do vang sheeting only in strong air.

#### Close reach & beam reach

When close & beam reaching vang is always used.

**The approximate setting for the vang is the tension required to set the top batten parallel with the boom.**

The exact setting will depend on the wind strength.

 - Light and very light airs - vang with little tension - we want twist
 - Medium and stronger airs - vang pulled hard - we need less twist

**When reaching in stronger airs, easing the mainsheet during gusts may not be enough to stop the boat from broaching**
**Easing the vang may be the only way to not broach**
TODO? Why? Aren't we depowering the sail by tightening the vang?

#### Broad reach & running

Vang should be set to keep top batten parallel to the boom.

### Halyard

Halyard hoists the mainsail.

Halyard and cunningham both control the tension int the luff of the sail.

This affects the position of the belly of the sail as well as flattening the sail.

 - More halyard tension -> belly moves forward towrds mast, sail becomes flatter
 - Less halyard tension -> belly moves backwards

The goal is usually to get the belly in the middle of the sail.

### Outhaul

Controls the size of the belly in its lower third.

Never ease the outhaul more than 15%(of the overall length of the sail's foot).
